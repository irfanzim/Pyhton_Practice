    "\n",
    "Based on the overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`df_customer`**:\n",
    "    * `became_member_on`: Is an `object` (string). It **must** be converted to `datetime` to analyze membership tenure.\n",
    "    * `gender`: Contains 3 values ('M', 'F', 'O').\n",
    "    * `age` & `income`: Are numerical with no missing values. I will bin these later to analyze cohorts. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`df_event`**:\n",
    "    * `event`: Has 4 unique values as expected ('offer received', 'offer viewed', 'offer completed', 'transaction').\n",
    "    * `offer_id`, `amount`, `reward`: Have significant missing values. This is **expected** and not an error.\n",
    "        * `offer_id` is null only for 'transaction' events.\n",
    "        * `amount` is null only for 'offer' events.\n",
    "        * `reward` is null for all except 'offer completed' events.\n",
    "    * This structure confirms a central challenge: `offer_id` and `amount` are in separate rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`df_offer`**:\n",
    "    * `duration`: This is in **days**. The `df_event['time']` column is in **hours**. These units are incompatible. **Need** to standardize them. **Need** to convert `duration` to hours.\n",
    "    * `channels`: Is an `object` (a string that looks like a list). This is unusable for analysis and must be cleaned for channel effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The data is structurally sound, but the `duration`/`time` unit mismatch is a critical flaw that must be fixed. The `became_member_on` conversion is also mandatory."
